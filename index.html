      <h2>Week 1: Settling In and Getting Started (5/26–5/30)</h2>
      <p>
      My first week in Huntsville was filled with meeting new people, learning new things, and seeing things I didn't even know existed.  From the very start, Leidos Dynetics has created an environment that’s not only technically exciting but also genuinely supportive. Everyone I’ve met has been welcoming, curious about our work, and more than willing to share their own experiences and advice.
      <br/> My friends and I arrived on Monday (5/26), moved into the Airbnb, and immediately  got to work exploring the materials Mundy had given us to study. 
      <br/>
      The following few days were focused on getting oriented, meeting new people, setting up our spaces, and learning more about our projects. Mundy was great about giving us a strong start and making sure we were comfortable. What stood out to me the most this week was the company culture. I could've never imagined how inviting and just generally nice the community at Leidos Dynetics is, especially the AI and Machine Learning Branch. 
      <br/>
      I'm more than excited to keep building on this momentum and continue learning new things everyday.
